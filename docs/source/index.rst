Welcome to defyes's documentation!
==================================

DeFyes is a Python library designed to track DeFi portfolios across multiple protocols.
This library serves as a versatile toolkit to retrieve DeFi positions' underlying
assets and financial metrics.

The project is currently undergoing active development, so we expect some backward incompatibility changes until we stabilize the API. We encourage you to stay engaged with the project's updates and contribute to its evolution.

While cross-chain functionalities are supported, currently most integrations are focused on Ethereum
and Gnosis Chain.
